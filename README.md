ZIO Microservice supports the features you need to be productive:

 * **Endpoints**. Define reliable and scalable endpoints concisely, type-safely, and composably.
 * **Protocol-Agnostic**. Deploy endpoints to any supported protocol, including HTTP and gRPC.
 * **Stream-friendly**. Handle requests and responses that are too big to fit in memory at once.
   * WebSockets
 * Introspection-friendly
   * **Documentation**. Generate documentation that is automatically in-sync with the endpoints.
   * **Client**. Interact with an endpoint type-safely from Scala without writing any code.
 * Middleware-friendly. Middleware is type-safe and compositional and can include built-in middleware or third-party middleware, or combinations.
   * **Metrics/Monitoring**. Built-in integration with ZIO Metrics.
   * **Rate-limiting**. Customizable rate-limiting with DDOS protection.
   * **Logging**. Request/response logging in Common Log format.
